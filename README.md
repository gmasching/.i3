## My i3 setup

This is my confguration file for the ![i3](https://i3wm.org/) window manager

## i3 Controls

On an apple keyboard Mod4 = Command, on a windows keyboard Mod4 = alt.

`Mod4` + `enter` = Open terminal emulator

`Mod4` + `Shift` + `q` = [q]uit

`Mod4` + [`1`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`,`6`,`7`,`8`,`9`,`0`] = switch to desktop number

`Mod4` + `Shift` + [`1`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`,`6`,`7`,`8`,`9`,`0`] = move window to desktop number

`Mod4` + `f` = [f]ullscreen

`Mod4` + `Shift` + [`up`,`down`,`left`,`right`] = move selected window

`Mod4` + `t` = use [t]abbed mode

`Mod4` + `p` = select [p]arent

`Mod4` + `Shift` + `o` = toggle floating window

In addition, there are keys added for muting, increasing, and decreasing volume.

## i3bar

This is what my i3bar looks like:

`Ethernet 192.168.x.x at xxx xbit/s | 0.93 | â™ª 0% | xxx GiB Disk Space | Tuesday July 23 6:59:20 xx xx`

which corresponds to:
`Ethernet usage | cpu usage with respect to cores | audio volume | Disk space left | date, time, other app icons`

## Installation
put the "config" file at ~/.config/i3/
put the .i3status.conf at ~/
